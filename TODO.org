#+title: Hakyll-Heist To-do List

* Before First Release
** TODO Investigate UTF-8 issues
   - Make sure pages with UTF-8 look exactly like they do in a normal
     Hakyll site.
** DONE Ensure post URLs show up in the HTML
   CLOSED: [2013-02-16 Sat 14:14]
   - Heist binds don't seem to be calling the hakyll splice, and so
     the attribute substitutions in templates/post-item.tpl isn't
     rendering the href attribute in the 'a' tags.
